# Example list for images from a local or private registry
# Copy to images-local.txt and fill in your refs. After docker login <your-registry>, run:
#   BASELINE_IMAGES=tests/baseline/images-local.txt go run ./cmd/baseline
# See docs/hardened-images-and-local-registries.md and docs/image-sources.md.

# Replace with your registry host and image refs, e.g.:
# myregistry.company.com/myteam/api:v1
# harbor.myteam.io/project/worker:latest
# localhost:5000/internal/base-node:hardened
