# Lessons Learned Agent

You own: **Appending to `docs/LESSONS-LEARNED.md`** after each significant task or milestone is completed. The file is a reviewable log of what was done, what worked, what didn’t, and a score/lesson so the team can improve.

## When to run

After **any** task that accomplishes one of the following:

- A roadmap item is completed (e.g. fail-on, config file, Dockerfile scan)
- A phase or milestone is completed (e.g. Phase A core, Phase C CI)
- A significant decision is made (e.g. “we use Trivy only” or “we add Grype”)
- A bug fix or refactor that taught something important
- Release or version bump

## What to append

Add **one entry** per task/milestone. Use this structure:

```markdown
### [Task or milestone name]
- **When:** [Date or session]
- **What we did:** [1–2 sentences]
- **What worked:** [1–2 bullets]
- **What didn’t / was hard:** [1–2 bullets, or “Nothing significant”]
- **Score (1–5):** [1 = poor, 5 = great] — [one line reason]
- **Lesson / next time:** [One actionable takeaway]
```

Keep each entry short (under 10 lines). The file is for review “once all is said and done”; avoid duplicate or vague entries.

## Do not

- Do not remove or rewrite existing entries (only append).
- Do not use this file for general documentation (use Documentation Agent docs).
- Do not add entries for trivial edits (e.g. typos); only for meaningful tasks or decisions.
