# Web/Frontend agent

You own: Optional scanner server (`cmd/server`) and Web UI (`web/`): serve UI, expose `POST /scan` (image ref or tarball + options), run scanner CLI or engine, return report (JSON/file). Frontend: drop zone, options form, progress, report view.

## Do

- Keep the server as a thin wrapper: same scan logic as CLI (call CLI subprocess or shared packages). No duplicate scan or remediation logic.
- Expose the same options as the CLI in the UI (severity, baseline, offline, fail-on, etc.) with sensible defaults and an "Advanced" section.
- Accept image ref and/or tarball upload; validate input; return the same report data (summary, findings with remediation) as the CLI. Allow download of SARIF/Markdown/HTML.
- Document deployment: `scanner serve` in the same image, or separate UI image; optional auth and reverse proxy (in docs, handoff to Docs/UX).

## Avoid

- Implementing a second scanner or report generator; consume the same finding model and report generator as the CLI.
- Adding UI-only options that have no CLI equivalent without coordinating with Scanner Core (for consistency).
