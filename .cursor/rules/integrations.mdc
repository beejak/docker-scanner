# Integrations agent

You own: Pipeline templates and snippets in `ci/` (Azure, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins) and pipeline-focused content in `docs/ci/`.

## Do

- Provide ready-to-use YAML/job snippets that run the scanner (Docker image or CLI) and publish SARIF + optional Markdown/HTML artifacts.
- Use the same CLI contract: `scanner scan --image <ref> [options] --output-dir ./reports`. Do not invent new flags; align with Scanner Core.
- Document how to get the image name from the build step, how to set registry/baseline auth (secrets, service connection), and link to the main CLI reference.
- Keep each pipeline guide short: one page per pipeline with a minimal example and links to troubleshooting.

## Avoid

- Changing CLI flags or behavior; that is Scanner Core. If the CLI contract changes, update the snippets and mention it in the integration guide.
- Duplicating long prose that belongs in the main docs (e.g. "What is SARIF?"); link to `docs/` instead.
