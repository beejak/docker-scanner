# Vulnerability reports

The scanner enriches every finding with **why it has that severity**, **whether it is known to be exploitable**, and **how it can be exploited** (when we have data). This helps you prioritize fixes and spot gaps in testing.

## Report columns (Markdown, HTML, CSV)

In addition to CVE, Package, Severity, Path, and Remediation, reports include:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **Exploitable** | `yes` = listed in CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV); `no` = not in KEV; `unknown` = offline or non-CVE finding. |
| **Why severity** | Short explanation of why the finding is Critical/High/Medium/Low (e.g. "Critical: often RCE, auth bypass…"). |
| **Exploit info** | For KEV items: CISA short description and, when applicable, "Known ransomware campaign use." Otherwise: "Check NVD and vendor advisories." |

Use these to focus first on **Exploitable = yes** and **Severity = CRITICAL**.

## CISA KEV and severity

- When **online**, the scanner fetches the [CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) catalog and caches it for 24 hours.
- Any CVE in that catalog is marked **Exploitable = yes** and its severity is treated as **CRITICAL** for prioritization (so you don’t miss actively exploited issues).
- **Offline** (`--offline`): we do not fetch KEV; Exploitable is set to **unknown** and Exploit info is generic.

## Why severity (generic text)

- **Critical** — Often RCE, auth bypass, or severe impact; check NVD/CVSS for details.
- **High** — Significant impact; may allow privilege escalation or data exposure.
- **Medium** — Moderate impact; may require specific conditions to exploit.
- **Low** — Limited impact or difficult to exploit.

You can still use NVD/CVSS and vendor advisories to refine prioritization; the "Why severity" text is a quick, consistent explanation from the scanner.

## Gaps and testing

- **Baseline run** (100+ images): use `go run ./cmd/baseline` to scan the full image list. The resulting CSV/Markdown shows **Findings** and **Duration (s)** per image so you can see which images or stacks have more issues and where the scanner might be slow or missing coverage.
- **Exploitable = yes**: if your baseline report has many Critical/exploitable items, focus remediation there first; if you see none, that may indicate older or well-patched images—or a need to add more “real-world” images to the list.
- **Missing CVEs**: the scanner relies on Trivy’s DB and CISA KEV. For exploit status beyond KEV, check NVD and vendor advisories (linked in the report).
